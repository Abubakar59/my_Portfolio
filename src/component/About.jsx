          I’m a  React Developer with a BSc in Computer Science, passionate about crafting seamless, user-friendly web applications. My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and problem-solving, which I apply daily to build efficient and scalable applications. I specialize in React.js, where I focus on creating dynamic, interactive front-end solutions that meet modern user expectations.


          Beyond my coding skills, I also have a unique expertise in phone repairs. I’m an expert in diagnosing and fixing mobile devices, which has helped me develop a keen attention to detail, troubleshooting skills, and the ability to solve complex issues under pressure. This hands-on experience has further strengthened my problem-solving abilities, whether I’m fixing a device or debugging code.


          I’m constantly looking to expand my knowledge and grow as a developer, bringing my diverse skill set to any project I take on. Whether it’s developing cutting-edge web applications or fixing tech issues, I’m ready to tackle challenges and help drive success.
